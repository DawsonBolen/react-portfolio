We created an NBA Highlights app that allows the user to search up a team, get that teams record, and get game stats for every game of their season. Additionally, it used the youtube api to retrieve relevant videos. My personal job was being the main person in charge of the NBA Api. It was a very simple api which limitied what we could do. It just returned raw text data, however, because of this I really got to practice and refine my skills with JavaScript logic. Try it out for yourself. To view the code view our github Repo.',

We don't actually sell anything, but it is made as a mock up of a full-stack ecommerce site. We used node.js, express, sql, sequelize, and handlebars to make the site. Everything works, but keep in mind we were limited to two weeks to complete this. Not everything is seeded, the only categories with products so far are automotive and shoes. You can even post products, but you need to post the link of an image, we didn't have enough time to incorporate an image drop or upload API. I was responsible for the design, all the css, and the majority of the front-end JavaScript. I also helped slightly with models and routing. I created the logos and graphics in Illustrator.",
