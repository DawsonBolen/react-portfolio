        description: "EZ trade was a full stack ecommerce site that I made along with a group for a project. We used Handlebars, JavaScript, Express, Node, and CSS. I helped slightly with routing and express, but my role was primarily front end. I did the majority of the front end work. I did all of the design and css, created all of our graphics using adobe Illustrator, designed the logo, and did the majority of the front-end JavaScript and handlebars. We used live share, so it probably looks like one member did all of the pushes, but everyone contributed. The project manager took it down so he wouldn't be charged so you can clone the repo and run npm i and npm run dev to view our site in action. I will work to get a walkthrough video up in the next week or so.  ",

Additionally, I designed it and created our graphics in illustrator. In addition to the MERN stack, we also used graphql, apollo client, and jwt web tokens for authentication. ",
