I built the site with React and aside from a clean modern design and custom React components, I also built a Node.js / Express CMS system for Alpha Builders to update and upload new content. The CMS system is hosted on app engine and allows image posting to accompany project posts. The images are uploaded to a Google Cloud Platform storage bucket for storage and retrieval. Additionally the site has a working email form. ",

I did all of the design and css, created all of our graphics using adobe Illustrator, designed the logo, and did the majority of the front-end JavaScript and handlebars. We used live share, so it probably looks like one member did all of the pushes, but everyone contributed. The project manager took it down so he wouldn't be charged so you can clone the repo and run npm i and npm run dev to view our site in action.
