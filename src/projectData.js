Additionally, it used the youtube api to retrieve relevant videos. My personal job was being the main person in charge of the NBA Api. It was a very simple api which limitied what we could do. It just returned raw text data, however, because of this I really got to practice and refine my skills with JavaScript logic. Try it out for yourself. ",

We don't actually sell anything, but it is made as a mock up of a full-stack ecommerce site. We used node.js, express, sql, sequelize, and handlebars to make the site. Everything works, but keep in mind we were limited to two weeks to complete this. Not everything is seeded, the only categories with products so far are automotive and shoes. You can even post products, but you need to post the link of an image, we didn't have enough time to incorporate an image drop or upload API. I was responsible for the design, all the css, and the majority of the front-end JavaScript. I also helped slightly with models and routing. I created the logos and graphics in Illustrator. We also used liveshare so I don't have many commits, I would add them when we met during live share and the project manager would push them. Our project manager took it down from Heroku so it wouldn't charge him. To see our site in action you will have to clone repo and run npm i and npm run dev. I will try to contact my group and try to get a walkthrough video created. ",

I helped a little bit with graph and would have to work with it to get the front end to work properly. I did the majority of the react and all of the css. Additionally, I designed it and created our graphics in illustrator. In addition to the MERN stack, we also used graphql, apollo client, and jwt web tokens for authentication. ",
